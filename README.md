An comparison of financial health of 5 publically traded CRISPR Companies
CRISPR is a DNA editing technology that was discovered in 2012. Since then, many companies have been started to leverage the technology. CRISPR companies have been started in agriculture, healthcare and biotechnology. In this analysis, I have analyzed the financial health of 5 of the largest publically traded CRISPR Companies (CRISPR Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Bluebird Bio, Intellia and Beam Therapeutics). The metrics I looked at market cap, revenue, assets and operating income of these companies. This analysis may lead to a better investment decision and employemnt considerations.

# Business/industry/civic/research question
My current PhD thesis deals with understanding the chemical and physical nature of CRISPR in the context of biology. I also have background in business strategy as a business analyst for a botique strategy consulting firm. Here, I combine these two interests to provide insight to the business of CRISPR. This motivates the question; what CRISPR company is the most financially healthy? According to BCC Research the CRISPR industry was $75B in 2018, and is estimated to be $218 billion by 2027. 

# Data question
To understand the financial health of companies, it is important to look at their balance sheet and income statements. These two documents outline how money is spent, earned, and utilized by the company. To identify the top 5 CRIPSR companies, (1) I looked at the market cap for releveant companies. To measure the money earned, (2) I recorded the revenue over the past 3 years. These companies are early stage and pre-clinical, so revenue is not necessarily the most important metric. (3) I looked at the operating income to see how the money is being spent on an ongoing basis. (4) I also looked at the assests, which may reveal how well the R&D or platform technology is.
