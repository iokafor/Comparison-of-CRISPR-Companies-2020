An comparison of financial health of 5 publically traded CRISPR Companies
CRISPR is a DNA editing technology that was discovered in 2012. Since then, many companies have been started to leverage the technology. CRISPR companies have been started in agriculture, healthcare and biotechnology. In this analysis, I have analyzed the financial health of 5 of the largest publically traded CRISPR Companies (CRISPR Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Bluebird Bio, Intellia and Beam Therapeutics). The metrics I looked at market cap, revenue, assets and operating income of these companies. This analysis may lead to a better investment decision and employemnt considerations.
